                    <h5>An important message from the Nspire team:</h5>
                    <p>After much deliberation, introspection, and many difficult conversations, it is with significant regret that we announce the indefinite postponing of our National Business and Technology Conference (NBTC). This comes as a result of numerous organizational, financial, and logistical challenges that we were unable to overcome in spite of our best efforts. Our goal has always been to provide the best possible experience for those who support and attend our events, and we hope to meet and exceed expectations with regards to this goal at new events in the coming months and years.</p>
                    <p>To our delegates, we thank you for your interest in being a part of the Nspire experience! For the better part of two decades, NBTC has been defined by the many talents and ideas brought forward by its attendees. These young people are — as ever — the leaders, big thinkers, and doers of tomorrow, and we look forward to further engaging with them at future Nspire events!</p>
                    <p>To the sponsors, speakers, and supporting community who form the backbone of NBTC, we thank you for your commitment and your time, and for your willingness to contribute to a medium wherein ideas and opportunities can flourish. We look forward to continuing our relationships in the future, at events that — more than ever before — bring together students and some of the country’s most exciting institutions, companies, and their biggest ideas.</p>
                    <h5>Thank you all again for your continued interest in our events,<br><br>The Nspire Team.</h5>
